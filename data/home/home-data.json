Aaron’s combination of extraordinary will and mental toughness allowed him to keep his spirits up even in the darkest of moments. He never asked for any assistance through this ordeal, but as a fraternity, and as his brothers, we felt it our responsibility to show our support in his time of need. We opened our fund to the public to see if people would be willing to assist in our efforts and to our surprise we had an influx of responses from individuals, other Lambda Chi Alpha chapters, as well as other Greek organizations.","Because of everyone involved we were able to raise over $12,000 for Aaron. This money went to him and his family to help ease the financial strain brought on from this terrible disease.","-Thank you for your generosity,","Lambda Chi Alpha at Virginia Tech"],"img":"app/home/images/aaron.jpg"},{"title":"Welcome","date":"Jan. 26 2015","text":["Through the vision of Lambda Chi Alpha the Sigma Lambda chapter prepares and encourages collegiate men of good character, high ethics, and noble ideals to contribute positively to the world in which they live."],"img":"app/home/images/logo.gif"}]
