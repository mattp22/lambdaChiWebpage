The aim of this organization is to feed America’s hungry citizens through a nationwide network of member food banks and encourage our country in the fight to end hunger.\n\nWe are excited and are proud to say that we will be partnering with the Interfaith Food Pantry, serving Blacksburg in an effort to give back to the local community."},{"header":"Canned Food Drive","img":"http://cdn.buzzpo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/canned-food.jpg","text":"During our philanthropy, and at other times during the semester, we will be hosting canned food drives to help support Feeding America. It is a great way to donate, and over the past few years we have accumulated over 4000 cans and 1000 packs of ramen and pasta!\n\nDonating cans isn't the only way to give back either! If you would rather just donate money to the cause you can follow this link: http://vtlxa.squarespace.com/ and scroll down to the donation portion to make your donation."},{"header":"Field Games","img":"app/philanthropy/images/watermelon.jpg","text":"Field games is our most popular event during our philanthropy. All teams compete in watermelon eating contests, watermelon toss competitions and tug of war! It's a great way to bring awareness to Feeding America and having fun at the same time!\n\nAlong with this event we also do a poster contest where all participants design their own Watermelon Bust posters and bring them to the event. We then have brothers vote on which ones are the best and the winner gets a special prize! They are all then hung outside the Lambda Chi house to be admired by all."}]
