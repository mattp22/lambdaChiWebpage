        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
            “To provide the funding to continue and expand leadership development and educational programs for Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity and its related constituencies, and to perpetuate the existence of these programs for future generations of youth as a complement to the experience of higher education.”
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
            The Educational Foundation believes in preparing and encouraging collegiate men of good character, high ethics, and noble ideals to contribute positively to the world in which they live.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Lambda Chi Alpha Educational Foundation is a separate charitable and educational tax-exempt organization, separate and independent from the Fraternity, whose sole purpose is to serve as an educational resource for the brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. Dollars raised go toward educational programming and initiatives, such as the Stead Leadership Seminar and Lambda Chi Alpha’s TRUE Brother Initiative, to help build and invest in Lambda Chi Alpha’s future leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Educational Foundation is governed by 23 Board of Directors consisting of distinguished alumni brothers across the globe. The Educational Foundation’s professional staff is led by Mark A. Bauer (Cal State – Fullerton ’79) as president and CEO.

        <h2>Creed</h2>
        <p>
            We believe in Lambda Chi Alpha, and its traditions, principles, and ideals. The crescent is our symbol — pure, high, ever growing; and the cross is our guide — denoting service, sacrifice, and even suffering and humiliation before the world, bravely endured if need be, in following that ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
            May we have faith in Lambda Chi Alpha and passion for its welfare. May we have hope for the future of Lambda Chi Alpha and strength to fight for its teachings. May we have pure hearts, that we may approach the ideal of perfect brotherly love.
